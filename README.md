## How about gitbook to replace quip?

### pros

it's**plain text**, you are not kidnapped

WYSIWYG

has versioning that works far better

It can be used internally, but also to generate content for trainkitt

it's no longer modal:

![](blob:file:///d58d10bc-bf62-43ec-8885-0b1be764076f)

can do imgs easy

has metadata per file

It's[designed to be published](#)

Works offline

can link[internally](#)

has plugins

can do exercises

diffs are amazing

may get educational discount

### cons

copy paste imgs does't work

only 10 collaborators for $49

no spreadsheets, although it does basic tables

no molecular permissions per collaborator. Only per book, and we have only 10 per group.

no realtime edits

cannot invite particular people to a particular chapter

|  This  |  that |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1  |  2 |

## And to write books?

\(or proposals\)

### pros

spits out epub

You can have two people editing the draft at the same time

### cons

You would need to get an editor that understands this versioning thing

If you move a chunk of text to another file, it's hard to track it

it's not realtime collab
